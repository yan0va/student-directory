#Student Directory

##Makers Academy Weeks 1 & 2 Project



This was our first two week project that we did without using Test-driven development methodology. In the first week, we've built a very simple Ruby script that allowed us to maintain a list of students at Makers Academy. In the second week, we have added students' data and added statistics.


###About the Project

The student directory script allows you to manage the list of students enrolled on the course at Makers Academy in February 2014.


###Week 1 - Project Task:

* Show the list of all students ordered by name
* Add new students by asking the user to input the names

###Week 2 - Project Task:

* Show information about a given student
* Add information related to a particular student (e.g. hobbies)
* Create an interactive menu to ask the user what they would like to do
* Display aggregate info (statistics)
* Save the data to a file
* Load it from the file

###How to use

```
ruby directory.rb
```
